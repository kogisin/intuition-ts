title: 'Chapter 5: Rejection Main'
summary: 'Practice staking on the “negative” / “inverse” of a claim.'
---

# Overview:

As you’ve now learned, each Claim in Intuition has two Vaults: a 'positive' Vault representing affirmation of the Claim, and a 'negative' Vault representing its rejection.

In this exercise, you will stake on the 'negative' Vault of a Claim, indicating that you believe the statement within the Claim to be false.

For instance, staking on the 'negative' Vault of the Claim [Vitalik] [founderOf] [Ethereum] signifies that you disagree with the statement that Vitalik is the founder of Ethereum.

This mechanism tightly integrates sentiment with the statement, eliminating the need for separate statements to express agreement or disagreement.

# Instructions:

Now, practice by staking against a Claim of your choice!

Please note that it is not possible to stake on both the Positive and Negative Vaults of a Claim simultaneously; you must withdraw your entire position from one Vault before staking on the other.
