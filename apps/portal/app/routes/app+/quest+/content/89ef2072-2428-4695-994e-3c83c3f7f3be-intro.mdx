summary: 'Practice staking on the “negative” / “inverse” of a claim.'

Your perspective shifts, duality showing its face.

The sea of Triples turns from blue to red; a sea of positivity turns to negativity.

An ecosystem of Atoms, once again connected, but not desiring to be.

These Atoms call out to you, urging you to restore their independence…

The flames swirl in agitation, no longer offering comfort and love but instead stirring anxiety, fear, and disgust…

These Atoms are not meant to be connected in this way.

Lies are being told here. And you... are a soldier of truth.

Again, understanding floods your awareness - the same realization as before.

Your intention is all-powerful. To remedy the situation, all that is required is…You.

As you focus on the need to separate these Atoms, the bonds between them begin to weaken…
