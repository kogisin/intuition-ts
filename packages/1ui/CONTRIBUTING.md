## About this package

- We use [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) to style the components.
- We use [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org/) for documenting and displaying the components.
- We use [ShadCN](https://ui.shadcn.com/) and [Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/) as our base component layer.
